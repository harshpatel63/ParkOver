# ParkOver
An Android application that helps you find a parking spot in a crowded area. Powered by Geospatial API and AR.

Why Geospatial API ?  
The Geospatial API provides for an anchor's horizontal (latitude and longitude) and vertical (altitude) positions following the WGS84 specification. You can place a Geospatial anchor almost anywhere in the world at a given latitude, longitude and altitude without needing to manually map the space and it provides accurate location based on the spaces around you.

How the app works:  
It has two layers a map layer to show the parking spaces available around the area and an AR layer that gives the pin pointed information about the location and realtime details on the parking spots nearby.
